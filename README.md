# XboxThemeMod
Sets a random theme color every time you boot your console.


I'm not going to include much info on how to mod this script to your profile or how to set it up. you should be able to set this script up on your own web server fairly easily. After you have it hosted and set up get your url (ex. https://unsha.red/xbox/random.php) then add it your profile, and boom, everytime you boot your Xbox One the theme will be a different color.
